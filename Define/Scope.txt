Scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable can be referred/used.

 A variable defined inside a method is called local variable.
 Its scope starts from its declaration and continues to the end of the block that contains the variable.
 It must be declared and assigned a value before it can be used.
 Parameters are also local variables, their scope is the whole method.
