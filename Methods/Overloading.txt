If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.
Return types don't play any roles in method overloading, it depends on  
1. type of parameters 
2. number of parameters
In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.



public static void main(Strinf[]args){
    sayHi();
    System.out.println( sayHi("Hello world!") );
}

public static void sayHi() {
    System.out.println("Hi");
}

public static void sayHi(String name) {
    return "Hi" + name;
}
